# optobot
A CV algorithm capable of capturing a dynamic candlestick graph of stock prices and predict the trade option. 

All references are implicit.

This project repository covers multiple approaches for predicting a good trade outcome. Out of them, the only approach that's been seen through to completion and gives relatively reliable profits over short time spans is the 3 candlestick approach.

To run the program : 

1. Download the pale moon browser.
2. Pip install all the dependencies in case your system doesn't have all the required packages.
3. Run the python script 'optobot_v1.0' under the '3-candlestick-approach' directory.
